Pan and Tilt Face Tracking Project
This project enables pan and tilt face tracking using an ESP32-CAMERA and and an Arduino uno R3 for controlling two servos so it can follow the detected face. The program is complete and functional, allowing the user to track and follow faces using a pan and tilt mechanism.

Features
Face Tracking: The program uses CVzone to detect and track faces in real-time.
Pan and Tilt Control: Integrated with a pan and tilt mechanism to physically follow detected faces.
it has a dead zone for the center of the frame so it will have an smooth face trackion.
and it will go back to ideal position if it dont detect any face for 3 second.
How to Use
you will need to have an arduino ide and IDLE and required libraries.
